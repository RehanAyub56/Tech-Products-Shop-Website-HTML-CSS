Gadget World is a fully functional, multi-page website I designed and developed using HTML5 and CSS3. This project showcases a modern gadget and tech platform, offering a clean and interactive user experience across six uniquely designed pages:

✅ Home Page – A sleek landing page displaying trending tech products like smartphones, tablets, and accessories, with a promotional banner, user-friendly navigation bar, and engaging layout.

✅ Community News Page – Lists the latest local announcements and updates in a checklist format to keep users informed about the tech community and general happenings.

✅ Events Page – Highlights upcoming community and tech-related events with card-style layouts for details like date, location, and descriptions of activities.

✅ Local Business Directory Page – Connects users to trusted vendors and official sellers of featured gadgets through external links and organized listings.

✅ Resources Center Page – Offers helpful links to best-selling gadget lists, expert reviews, and product comparisons hosted on external trusted platforms (like Amazon, GSMArena, and TechRadar).

✅ Feedback Page – Allows users to submit reviews and suggestions via a simple form, supporting better user interaction and continuous improvement.

This project focuses on clean structure, and get better understanding of web-development and front-end development and my first project in the long journey of web-development . All pages are built with pure HTML and CSS, without frameworks, demonstrating a strong foundation in frontend web development and layout design.
